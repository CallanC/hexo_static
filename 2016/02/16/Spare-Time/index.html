<h2 id="On-Twitch…"><a href="#On-Twitch…" class="headerlink" title=" On Twitch… "></a><strong> On Twitch… </strong></h2><p>On Twitch, I watch mainly three streamers. I prefer watching <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/markeedragon" target="_blank" rel="external">MarkeeDragon</a> from time to time.<br>MarkeeDragon mainly streams EVE-Online and has discounts for EVE-Online to start your online experience off a little better.</p>
<p>When MarkeeDragon is not streaming, I am also watching and supporting <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/imaqtpie" target="_blank" rel="external">imaqtpie</a> imaqtpie who mainly streams <strong> League of Legends. </strong><br>He has some neat commentary and is overall interesting to watch as well as the plays he is able to pull through at times. </p>
<p>At night, around 11PM Mountain Standard Time, I end up watching <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/lastfairdeal" target="_blank" rel="external">LastFairDeal</a> Patrick, or “LastFairDeal”, on Twitch if the night is slow. His commentary on the video games he plays and how he reacts to situations can often be humurous.<br>He is open minded on his chat and allows jokes to be posted as long as they are not hurtful towards anyone. </p>
<h2 id="Video-Games…"><a href="#Video-Games…" class="headerlink" title=" Video Games… "></a><strong> Video Games… </strong></h2><p>During more slow nights or mornings, I enjoy playing a few video games. On the off chances, I enjoy playing League of Legends with friends from <a href="https://www.sanctumgp.com" target="_blank" rel="external">SanctumGP</a> who can be found on TeamSpeak at ts.sanctumgp.com.<br>However, there are times where League of Legends is not all that entertaining and another game that I have been enjoying playing is <a href="https://www.bladeandsoul.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">BladeandSoul</a>. </p>
